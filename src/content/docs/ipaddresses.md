There are two main IP versions:

- **IPv4** (32‑bit addresses): originally sufficient, now exhausted  
- **IPv6** (128‑bit addresses): vast address space  

To extend IPv4 life, networks use *subnetting* and *Network Address Translation* (NAT). Home LAN devices get private IPv4 addresses; the router maps these to a single public IPv4 address. IPv6 does not change physical router setup.

Routers connect LAN and WAN. To host local servers, configure *port forwarding* in your router’s settings. For peer-to-peer discovery, look into STUN, TURN, and ICE protocols.
