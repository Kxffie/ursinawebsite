# Other Magic Functions

Trigger side-effects when an entityâ€™s state changes:

- **on_enable**: called when `enabled` becomes `True`  
- **on_disable**: called when `enabled` becomes `False`  
- **on_destroy**: called just before the entity is removed  

```python
def boom():
    print('Goodbye!')

e = Entity(on_destroy=boom)
destroy(e)  # prints "Goodbye!"
```
