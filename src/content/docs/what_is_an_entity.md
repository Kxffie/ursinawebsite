An entity is a thing in the world, and is the "god class" in Ursina.
It's like a GameObject in Unity or an Actor in Unreal.

It can have a position, rotation, and scale.
It can have a model, texture, and color.
It can have an update function, input function, and scripts.
For an overview of all its attributes and functions, see [API Reference - Entities](/api/entity)
