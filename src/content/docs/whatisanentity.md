# What is an Entity?

An entity is a thing in the world, and is the “god class” in Ursina. It’s like a GameObject in Unity or an Actor in Unreal.

It can have a position, rotation, and scale.  
It can have a model, texture, and color.  
It can have an update function, input function, and custom scripts.

For a full list of its attributes and methods, see [Entity](/api/entity).
